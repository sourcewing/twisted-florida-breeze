# Twisted Lobster — Premium Seafood Restaurant Website

## Design Vision
A luxurious, Floridian fine-dining website built around a rich lobster red primary color, complemented by warm sunset tones and deep dark backgrounds. The feel: an upscale dock-side restaurant at golden hour, with the bold red of a freshly cooked lobster as the signature accent.

## Color Palette
- **Primary**: Rich Lobster Red — bold, appetizing, signature brand color
- **Dark Background**: Deep Navy/Charcoal — sophistication and contrast
- **Gold**: Warm gold highlights — premium, luxe accents
- **Neutrals**: Warm sand, cream, soft white for text and light sections
- **Sunset accents**: Coral and burnt orange as secondary warm tones

## Typography
- Elegant serif headings (Playfair Display) for premium feel
- Clean sans-serif body text for readability
